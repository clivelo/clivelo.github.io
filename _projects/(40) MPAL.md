description: A python open source application for the analysis of hand motion.
---

A python open source application for the analysis of hand motion that was built during my research assistant job at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

## What is MPAL?
MPAL is a Python open-source and interactive application designed for analyzing hand motion. This application takes 3D coordinates retrieved from, for example, a motion tracking device, and visualizes the data frame-by-frame together with algorithm-generated labels that describe motion pattern. All folders and files under this repository are released under the GNU-GPL v3.0 license.
