This is a 2D raycasting visualization built in JavaScript with the p5.js library. Raycasting is a rendering technique that determines the perspective at a given position. A ray is cast at a particiular angle from a source, it calculates the closest intersection to an opaque object. Many perspective games use this technique to render from the character/camera's position what can be seen.

## Raycasting Algorithm
Given two end points of a ray and two end points of a wall, whether a ray and a wall are intersected and their intersection point are determined by the following pseudocode.

``` js
// (x1, y1) = first end point of the wall
// (x2, y2) = second end point of the wall
// (x3, y3) = first end point of the ray
// (x4, y4) = second end point of the ray

let intersection;
let intersection_pt;
let D = (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4);          // Denominator
let nT = (x1 - x3) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y3) * (x3 - x4);         // Numerator of T
let nU = (x1 - x2) * (y1 - y3) - (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3);         // Numerator of U
let t = nT / D;
let u = -nU / D;                                                // Determine the value of t and u

if (t > 0 && t < 1 && u > 0) {                                  // If t is between 0 and 1 & u is larger than 0, two lines are intersected
  intersection = true;
  intersection_pt = [x1 + t * (x2 - x1), y1 + t * (y2 - y1)];   // Intersection point coordinate is ( x1+t*(x2-x1), y1+t*(y2-y1) )
} else {
  intersection = false;
  intersection_pts = null;
}
```
