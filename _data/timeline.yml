  description: My thesis was on how individual preference of touch velocity pleasantness is manifested in neural 
               activity. I collected electroencephalogram (EEG) data and analyzed them on MATLAB with the EEGLAB 
               plugin. I employed k-means clustering to find out subjective preference patterns and classify their 
               neural manifestation using SVM. I also took on teaching assistant duties every semester, my duties 
               include teaching tutorials, grading assignments and exams, and responding to students' inquires.

  description: I assisted in research projects investigating the properties of affectionate physical touch 
               and rhythmic neural entrainment of social perception. My tasks involved data collection, 
               substantial data analysis, and lab maintenance. I had ample experience in processing audio and 
               video data in Python (OpenCV, Librosa, SciPy) and MATLAB. I had major involvement in organizing, 
               pre-processing, and analyzing data from a 3D motion tracking device in Python by building an 
               application named MPAL. I utilized supervised machine learning models in an attempt to categorize 
               trajectory patterns of motion data; models were built using Scikit-learn in Python. I was also 
               responsible for creating a Linux server in the lab for backing up our sensitive data.

  description: I assisted in two research projects regarding game-based treatment efficacy in improving 
               childrenâ€™s working memory and attention. Participants of interest were children with special 
               educational needs and preemies. My tasks involved providing assessment to children pre- and post- 
               treatment, literature reviews, data analysis, and writing training manuals. I built a simple 
               application with a GUI in Java for ease of data entry and calculation.

  description: I completed my final year project with a research in the field of cognitive psychology.
               The experiment was built using E-Prime. I completed literature reviews, data collection 
               and analysis, and paper write-up in the span of one academic year. I also completed a 
               half-year practicum as a teaching assistant in a special-needs early education centre named
               Watchdog. At the end of my study, I was the undergraduate representative of our university's
               Psychology degree programme review.
