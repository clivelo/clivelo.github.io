If you take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/clivelo" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>, you will see that I have quite a few projects built using the <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> library. It was my prelude to JavaScript when it was introduced to me by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw" target="_blank">The Coding Train</a> :train:.

p5.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to easily create visual elements that can be easily made interactable and animated. You start with a canvas that refreshes at a specified frame rate. On the canvas, you can use the library functions to create objects, shapes, texts, images etc. In the <i>draw()</i> function, it acts as an infinite <i>while</i> loop where you can code what you want to happen at each frame. The simple animation and drawing functionality makes it so much easier for anyone to create their own fun and creative projects. You can even integrate other libraries (I recommend <i>Matter.js</i> and <i>TensorFlow.js</i>) to make even more complex things, the possibilities are endless!

Itâ€™s a free and open-source library with its own <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank">web editor</a>! So if you are like me and find it a hassle to choose between all these different code editors and customization packages, you can use your web browser and get right to coding! Check it out!
